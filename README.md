# Command-Line Utility Tool

## Overview

This repository implements a command-line utility tool written in C++ and developed as part of Microsoft's [_C++ Programming Fundamentals_](https://www.coursera.org/learn/c-plus-plus-programming-fundamentals) course on Coursera. The project demonstrates an understanding of core C++ concepts, including syntax, data types, operators, control flow, and proper program structure.

## Project Requirements

Design and implement a multi-function command-line utility program that users can interact with via a text-based menu. The application must include:

1. A main menu interface that allows users to select between different utility functions.
2. At least four distinct utility functions.
3. Proper input validation for all user interactions.
4. Clear feedback to the user for successful operations and error conditions.
5. Well-organized, readable, and commented code that follows C++ best practices.

## Selected Utility Functions

The utility functions implemented in this project have been divided into number and text utilities.

The number utilities include:
- Fibonacci sequence generator.
- Number base converter.
- Prime number checker.
- Summary Statistics calculator.

The text utilities include:
- Substring find-and-replace tool.
- Palindrome checker.
- Random password generator.
- Word frequency counter.
